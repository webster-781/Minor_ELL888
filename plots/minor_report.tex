\section{Problem 1 : Missing Values}

\subsection{Idea}
Since we have missing values, we try multiple methods: either we impute missing values or we change the distance(dissimilarity) function.

\subsection{Basics}
In this question and in the following ones as well, I have used EEG dataset with 14 attributes and 2 output classes.
I have used KNN graph construction method to construct connectivity matrix($E_{ij} = 1$ or $0$) and then Gaussian Weights construction using the above connectivity matrix. 

To evaluate the efficiency of a constructed graph, I have used two metrics,
(i) Neighbourhood Efficiency of a node: Fraction of neighbours of the node which belong to the class of the neighbour.

(ii) Classification Efficiency of a node: If one was to classify this node using the majority of the classes of its neighbours, then if the classification is correct it gets efficiency 1, otherwise 0.

So, as a whole, the efficiencies of graphs as defined as:

(i) Neighbourhood Efficiency : Average Neighbourhood efficiency over all nodes

(ii) Classification Efficiency : Average Classification efficiency over all



\subsection{Method 1: new dissimilarity function}
We define a new dissimilarity function for attributes with missing values: 
For two data points $x_i, x_j \in \mathbb{R}^d$, with 
$N_{ij} = \{m \in \{1,2,..,d\} | x_{im} \text{and} x_{jm} \text{ are both not missing}\}$

Then,
special Distance between $i$ and $j$ is,
$d_s(i,j) = (\sum_{m \in N_{ij}}(x_{im} - x_{jm})^2)^{1/2}$
